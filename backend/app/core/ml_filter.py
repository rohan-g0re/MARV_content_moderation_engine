"""
ML Filter for GuardianAI (Future Implementation)

This module will implement the optional ML layer (TF-IDF classifier for context)
as specified in the project brief. Currently a placeholder for future development.

Planned Features:
- TF-IDF vectorization for context analysis
- Scikit-learn based classification
- Context-aware threat detection
- Confidence scoring
