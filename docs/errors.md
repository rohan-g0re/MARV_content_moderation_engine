## Day 1 - Project Setup Phase

### ‚úÖ Resolved Issues

#### Issue #1: Windows PowerShell Directory Creation
**Error:** PowerShell brace expansion not working for mkdir command
```bash
mkdir -p backend/app/{api,core,models,services,utils}
# Result: Missing argument in parameter list
```

**Root Cause:** Windows PowerShell doesn't support bash-style brace expansion

**Solution:** Use PowerShell-native `New-Item` command with array of paths
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "backend/app/api", "backend/app/core", "backend/app/models", "backend/app/services", "backend/app/utils" -Force
```

**Prevention:** Always use PowerShell-native commands when working on Windows systems

---

#### Issue #2: .env.example File Creation Blocked
**Error:** "Editing this file is blocked by globalIgnore"

**Root Cause:** .env files are typically in .gitignore, blocking their creation

**Solution:** Create environment template as `config/env.template` instead
- Alternative: Manually create .env.example file
- Ensure proper documentation in README for environment setup

**Prevention:** Check .gitignore patterns before creating configuration files

### üîÑ Current Session Issues

*No current issues - development proceeding smoothly*

---

## Development Environment Issues

### Common Windows PowerShell Issues
1. **Brace Expansion:** Use PowerShell arrays instead of bash brace expansion
2. **Path Separators:** Use forward slashes or PowerShell-native path handling
3. **Command Compatibility:** Some bash commands don't work - use PowerShell equivalents

### Python Virtual Environment Setup
*No issues encountered yet - will update when setting up virtual environment*

### API Integration Issues
*No issues encountered yet - will update when implementing Gemini API integration*

---

## Known Limitations & Workarounds

### Gemini API Rate Limiting
**Expected Issue:** API stalls and rate limits during data generation

**Planned Mitigation:**
- Implement 1-second delay between API calls
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implement request queuing system
- Error handling for rate limit responses

### Large Dataset Generation
**Expected Issue:** Long-running scripts for 10,000+ samples

**Planned Mitigation:**
- Progress tracking and logging
- Checkpoint saving for resume capability
- Batch processing with status updates
- Graceful interruption handling

## Error Resolution Workflow

1. **Document the Error:** Copy exact error message and context
2. **Identify Root Cause:** Analyze why the error occurred
3. **Implement Solution:** Apply fix and test thoroughly
4. **Update Documentation:** Add to this error log
5. **Prevention Strategy:** Note how to avoid similar issues
