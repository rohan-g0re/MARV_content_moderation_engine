## Day 1 Progress (Current)

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Project structure setup (modular architecture)
- [x] Created comprehensive .gitignore
- [x] Created README with PRD document
- [x] Set up requirements.txt with all dependencies (version-free)
- [x] Created directory structure for backend, frontend, data, scripts
- [x] Set up documentation framework
- [x] Created and tested synthetic data generation script
- [x] Generated 5000 synthetic samples with proper label distribution
- [x] Set up virtual environment with essential dependencies
- [x] Verified data quality and CSV format

### 🔄 In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Gemini-based data generation script (ready to test with API key)
- [ ] Virtual environment setup (optional - testing Gemini script)

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Python-based synthetic data generation script ✅ TESTED & WORKING
- [x] Virtual environment setup ✅ CREATED & ACTIVATED
- [x] Environment configuration setup ✅ TEMPLATE CREATED

### 📋 Remaining Day 1 Tasks
- [ ] Generate dataset with Gemini API (5000+ samples) - READY TO RUN (needs API key)
- [x] Generate dataset with Python synthetic script (5000+ samples) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Test both scripts thoroughly ✅ SYNTHETIC SCRIPT TESTED
- [x] Verify data quality and format consistency ✅ VERIFIED
- [x] Document any issues in error tracking ✅ UPDATED

### 🎯 Day 1 Success Criteria
- 2 working data generation scripts
- 10,000+ total samples across both datasets
- Consistent schema: Post (text) + Label (5-7 band classification)
- 1-second delay between Gemini API calls
- Modular project structure ready for future development
